# Stock Visualization Project

## Overview

This project is designed to explore and visualize stock market trends in an interactive and engaging way. 

The notebook, `Stock Visualization.ipynb`, walks you through retrieving stock data, processing it, and visualizing trends using Python's popular data science libraries.

## Key Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Fetch stock data effortlessly from various sources using APIs or preloaded datasets.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensure your data is ready for analysis with automated cleaning and formatting.
- **Technical Analysis**: Dive deeper with technical indicators like moving averages and the RSI (Relative Strength Index).
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the stock's performance with line charts, candlestick charts, and other custom plots.

## File Structure

- `Stock Visualization.ipynb`: The main notebook that holds the code, data, and visualizations for analyzing stock trends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure your system has the following:
- **Python 3.x**: The latest version of Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Run the notebook easily with Jupyter.
- **Python Libraries**: Install the required libraries using the following command:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance
  ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open `Stock Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in sequence and follow along with the explanations provided.
4. Make sure to input your desired stock symbols and configure the date range for a custom analysis.

## Customization

Feel free to make the project your own! Here are a few suggestions:
- **Stock Symbol**: Change the stock ticker symbol in the notebook to analyze different companies.
- **Date Range**: Modify the start and end dates to focus on specific periods.
- **Visualizations**: Add new types of plots or modify existing ones using the power of `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
